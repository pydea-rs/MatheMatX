# Heavy Power by C
* Calculates the power of positive integers, up to 2142909999 digits
* The approach is converting a number into an array of digits and implementing basic math
* The problem is broken into basic multiplication of the base, repeated 'power' times
=> Planted a console progress bar, in case the calculations are time consuming.
